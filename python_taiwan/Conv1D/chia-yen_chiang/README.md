## Origin
The user who raised the question was asking for whether or not her
implementation of the OS-CNN in Keras correct. A few screenshots of
her implementation is captured in `prime0{1,2,3}.jpg`.

To make this directory more user-friendly and, maybe more interesting,
I propose that we refer to the paper and try to really make use of
the model to run sth useful, i.e. demonstrating the power of OS-CNN
as advertised by the paper.

## Todo
01. Try to use TikZ to draw OS-CNN's architecture
